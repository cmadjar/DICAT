Naming convention according to https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Indentation:  Use 4 spaces per indentation level

Package and Module Names: Should be called one per line (yes:  import os;  no:  import os, tkinter, ttk)

Class names: Use the CapWords convention

Function names:  Use lowercase with words separated by underscores

Method names:  Use lowercase with words separated by underscores
               Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables
               To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.

Instance variable names: Use lowercase with words separated by underscores

Constant names: Use uppercase with words separated by underscores. Constant should only be defined at the module level.
